Q.What will be the output of following:
void main()
{
  int val=10;
  cout<<val++<<val<<++val;
}
Ans...
  10 11 12
  However if you run the code really with appropriate header files you will not get these spaces.
  Now you can clearly see this.
  val++ ----> assigns the value 10 and then increases it by one i.e. 11
  val   ----> This has been made 11 by the above
  ++val ----> This will increase val first that is makes it 12 and then assigns i.e. shows 12.
